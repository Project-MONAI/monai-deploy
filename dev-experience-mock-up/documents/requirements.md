### Introduction
Productionizing an AI model is difficult as there is a chasm between training an AI model and deploying it to a production environment. In the healthcare domain, this chasm involves more than just performing inference with a model. An App developer would need to address issues such as: ingestion of medical imaging datasets, performing application specific pre and post processing operations,  packaging output from the application, integration with clinical informatics systems & ensuring right compute resources are specified and utilized by the application at run-time 

The MONAI Application SDK provides a framework to develop, verify, analyze AI driven healthcare applications and integrate them with clinical information systems using industry standard protocols such as DICOM & FHIR. The SDK is aimed to support the following activities

* Pythonic Framework for app development
* A mechanism to locally run and test an app
* A lightweight app analytics module
* A lightweight 2D/3D visualization module
* A developer console that provides a visual interface to all assets needed for developing apps
* A set of sample applications
* API documentation & User's Guide

### [REQ] Representing application specific tasks using Operators
