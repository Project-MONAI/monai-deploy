** DICOM Payload Processed was only tested with low instance studies. Bug to be raised which ensures that the async nature of the sending of DICOMs doesn't timeout after 60 seconds.

** Task updated metrics were not useful at high load as systems are very chatty, work needs to be done to differentiate useful messages better.

| Task Dispatched   | 88           | 52     | WorkflowRequestRequeuePayloadProcessError was thrown 52 times for 14 payloads, this was due to the way the WorkflowManager was processing "Unable to locate a matching workflow for the given workflow request". It would seem that the WorkflowManager requeues WorkflowRequetEvents that do not match a Workflow AET and then throws an exception because that payload is already received and saved in Mongo. This does not affect functionality or performance |
